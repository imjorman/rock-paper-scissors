Beginning the rock-paper-scissors project on The Odin Project's website.  Nervous about making a functional program, but excited to get into it.  Headed into the project, I imagine it will be a simple process of getting two inputs, comparing them, and then printing the result based on the inputs:
if inputs equal = declare it a tie.
if input1 is a rock, make decisions based on input2
if input1 is a paper, make decisions based on input2
if input1 is a scissor, make decisions based on input2


AFTER PROJECT THOUGHTS
-Really enjoyed working through the problem.  In one of the instructional lectures we were told to watch, the presenter said something like "it's always okay to look up code, but it's never okay to look up how to solve the problem."  I hadn't heard it put that way before, and in this project I did my best in problem solving.  I didn't know the "prompt" syntax, so I felt comfortable looking that up, but otherwise I didn't look at any outside resources.

The main issue I encountered was getting the computer to make a different selection for each game played, and I realized I had to call the specific function each time in the loop, because it was always using the intial selection.  Once I got a handle on local/global variables, the project fixed itself and ran smoothly.
